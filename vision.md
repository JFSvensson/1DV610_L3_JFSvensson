# ZodiacCompanion
## Vision

ZodiacCompanion aspires to illuminate the realm of the Zodiac for those who find astrology intriguing, entertaining, or even just a delightful diversion. Our mission is to provide users with a portal into the enigmatic world of the Zodiac, bridging the past, present, and future constellations.

ZodiacCompanion is a tool designed to unveil the celestial dance of the cosmos. It answers the questions of which star sign the sun occupies on a given date, from both the astrological perspective - steeped in centuries of tradition, and the astronomical standpoint - grounded in precise celestial measurements. Additionally, we reveal the dynamic and ever-shifting position of the moon, keeping you in tune with the rhythms of the night sky.

Whether you're a seasoned stargazer, a casual horoscope reader, or simply someone who finds the mysteries of the Zodiac captivating, ZodiacCompanion welcomes you to explore the ever-turning wheel of the Zodiac with curiosity, wonder, and a touch of magic.
