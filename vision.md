# ZodiacCompanion
## Vision

Presenting the user with the past, present and future signs of the Zodiac. 

ZodiacCompanion is a tool for showing which star sign the sun is in according to a given date, both from the astrological point of view and the actual, astronomical sense. It also shows the more rapidly changing position of the moon.

## Requirements
The app must accurately determine the current zodiac sign based on the current date and time using the module [CelestialFinder](https://www.npmjs.com/package/celestialfinder) to get the position of the sun [#1](https://github.com/JFSvensson/1DV610_L3_JFSvensson/issues/1).

The user interface should prominently display the name of the current zodiac sign [#2](https://github.com/JFSvensson/1DV610_L3_JFSvensson/issues/2), and some additional information, such as symbol and dates.

Users must be able to input a specific date and time for which they want to know the historical zodiac sign [#3](https://github.com/JFSvensson/1DV610_L3_JFSvensson/issues/3).

The app must provide a section with detailed information about each zodiac sign [#4](https://github.com/JFSvensson/1DV610_L3_JFSvensson/issues/4) for entertainment purposes. Information should include the zodiac sign's symbol, element, ruling planet, personality traits, and compatibility with other signs.

Users should be able to navigate between different zodiac signs and access information about all 12 signs.
